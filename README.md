## Data Structures Covered
- **Arrays**: Basic operations (traversal, insertion, deletion).
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular.
- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO and FIFO implementations.
- **Trees**: Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.
- **Maps**: `std::map` and `std::unordered_map`.



## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the programs, you'll need a C++ compiler like `g++`.

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-project-name.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd your-project-name`

3.  Compile a specific file (e.g., `linked_list_operations.cpp`):
    `g++ linked_list_operations.cpp -o linked_list`

4.  Run the executable:
    `./linked_list`
